  abstract={This paper describes a novel approach for signature verification and identification in an offline environment based on a quasi-multiresolution technique using GSC (Gradient, Structural and Concavity) features for feature extraction. These features when used at the word level, instead of the character level, yield promising results with accuracies as high as 78\% and 93\% for verification and identification, respectively. This method was successfully employed in our previous theory of individuality of handwriting developed at CEDAR â€” based on obtaining within and between writer statistical distance distributions. In this paper, exploring signature verification and identification as offline handwriting verification and identification tasks respectively, we depict a mapping from the handwriting domain to the signature domain.}}
